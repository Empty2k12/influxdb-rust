//! This library is a work in progress. Although we've been using it in production at [OpenVelo](https://openvelo.org/),
//! we've prioritized features that fit our use cases. This means a feature you might need is not implemented
//! yet or could be handled better.
//!
//! Pull requests are always welcome. See [Contributing](https://github.com/Empty2k12/influxdb-rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Empty2k12/influxdb-rust/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
//!
//! ## Currently Supported Features
//!
//! -   Reading and Writing to InfluxDB
//! -   Optional Serde Support for Deserialization
//! -   Running multiple queries in one request (e.g. `SELECT * FROM weather_berlin; SELECT * FROM weather_london`)
//! -   Authenticated and Unauthenticated Connections
//! -   Optional conversion between `Timestamp` and `Chrono::DateTime<Utc>` via `chrono_timestamps` compilation feature
//! ## Planned Features
//!
//! -   Read Query Builder instead of supplying raw queries
//! -   `#[derive(InfluxDbReadable)]` and `#[derive(InfluxDbWriteable)]` proc macros
//!
//! # Quickstart
//!
//! Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`
//!
//! ```toml
//! influxdb = "0.0.5"
//! ```
//!
//! For an example with using Serde deserialization, please refer to [serde_integration](crate::integrations::serde_integration)
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use influxdb::{Client, Query, Timestamp};
//!
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() {
//! // Create a Client with URL `http://localhost:8086`
//! // and database name `test`
//! let client = Client::new("http://localhost:8086", "test");
//!
//! // Let's write something to InfluxDB. First we're creating a
//! // WriteQuery to write some data.
//! // This creates a query which writes a new measurement into a series called `weather`
//! let write_query = Query::write_query(Timestamp::Now, "weather")
//!     .add_field("temperature", 82);
//!
//! // Submit the query to InfluxDB.
//! let write_result = client.query(&write_query).await;
//! assert!(write_result.is_ok(), "Write result was not okay");
//!
//! // Reading data is as simple as writing. First we need to create a query
//! let read_query = Query::raw_read_query("SELECT * FROM weather");
//!
//! // submit the request and wait until it's done
//! let read_result = client.query(&read_query).await;
//!
//! assert!(read_result.is_ok(), "Read result was not ok");
//!
//! // We can be sure the result was successful, so we can unwrap the result to get
//! // the response String from InfluxDB
//! println!("{}", read_result.unwrap());
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! For further examples, check out the Integration Tests in `tests/integration_tests.rs`
//! in the repository.
