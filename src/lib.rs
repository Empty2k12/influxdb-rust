//! Library for talking to InfluxDB
//!
//! This library is a work in progress. Although we've been using it in production at [OpenVelo](https://openvelo.org/),
//! we're prioritized features that fit our use cases. This means a feature you might need is not implemented
//! yet or could be handled better.
//!
//! Pull requests are always welcome.
//!
//! # Currently Supported Features
//!
//!  * Reading and Writing to InfluxDB
//!  * Optional Serde Support for Deserialization
//!
//! # Planned Features
//!
//!  * Running multiple queries in one request (e.g. `SELECT * FROM weather_berlin; SELECT * FROM weather_london`)
//!  * Read Query Builder instead of supplying raw queries
//!  * Authentication against InfluxDB
//!  * Methods for setting time and time precision in a query
//!
//! # Quickstart
//!
//! Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`
//!
//! ```toml
//! influxdb = "0.0.1"
//! ```
//!
//! For an example with using Serde deserialization, please refer to [serde_integration](crate::integrations::serde_integration)
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use influxdb::query::{InfluxDbQuery, Timestamp};
//! use influxdb::client::InfluxDbClient;
//! use serde::Deserialize;
//! use tokio::runtime::current_thread::Runtime;
//!
//! // Create a InfluxDbClient with URL `http://localhost:8086`
//! // and database name `test`
//! let client = InfluxDbClient::new("http://localhost:8086", "test");
//!
//! // Let's write something to InfluxDB. First we're creating a
//! // InfluxDbWriteQuery to write some data.
//! // This creates a query which writes a new measurement into a series called `weather`
//! let write_query = InfluxDbQuery::write_query(Timestamp::NOW, "weather")
//!     .add_field("temperature", 82);
//!
//! // Since this library is async by default, we're going to need a Runtime,
//! // which can asynchonously run our query.
//! // The [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio) crate lets us easily create a new Runtime.
//! let mut rt = Runtime::new().expect("Unable to create a runtime");
//!
//! // To actually submit the data to InfluxDB, the `block_on` method can be used to
//! // halt execution of our program until it has been completed.
//! let write_result = rt.block_on(client.query(&write_query));
//! assert!(write_result.is_ok(), "Write result was not okay");
//!
//! // Reading data is as simple as writing. First we need to create a query
//! let read_query = InfluxDbQuery::raw_read_query("SELECT * FROM weather");
//!
//! // Again, we're blocking until the request is done
//! let read_result = rt.block_on(client.query(&read_query));
//!
//! assert!(read_result.is_ok(), "Read result was not ok");
//!
//! // We can be sure the result was successful, so we can unwrap the result to get
//! // the response String from InfluxDB
//! println!("{}", read_result.unwrap());
//! ```
//!
//! For further examples, check out the Integration Tests in `tests/integration_tests.rs`
//! in the repository.
